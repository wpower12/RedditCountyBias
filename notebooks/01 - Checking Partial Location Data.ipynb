    "## Location Data - Partial\n",
    "I was able to collect a list of 'location based' subreddits, and associate as many as I could with their actual, USA recognized counties using a geofencing API and the information provided by a reddit post summarizing all of the location subreddits by US state. This is just a partial data set, though, because I hit an error in the middle and lost my connection. Didn't have enough error handling implemented to gracefully take the error. But this should be enough data to atleast start writing the scripts for the rest of the data collection. Once that is proven to be working/interesting I'll go back and udpate the original data gather scripts to ensure they'll query the entire set of location subreddits. \n",

    "To start, I just want to open up the csv, get some stats, and start looking at a few individual subreddits to see if i can pull some users. I'll have to use PRAW again, so might need to muck about with the config/plumbing."

If pyro sprees weren't totally independent of mood they'd be fine, but the trait would still suck, having no positive upside unlike Neurotic and Too Smart.

I kept 25 hens and 1 rooster, with a massive haygrass farm, on my most well fed colony so far; I had something like 50 chickens slaughered per day, as I killed off every adolescent chicken daily, and something like 50 eggs were laid per day. I had more food than I could possibly fit in a freezer, so I ended up having to sell off chickens to traders every time they arrived.\n",

I like the mod, the firefights in it are pretty damn fun to watch go down, especially in the lategame, but when you have melee units who one hit knockdown and have shields that have such a strong base regen amount that if their quality is anything above normal they regen shields by over a 100% tickrate; which means every second their shield is basically jumping to 100% then Well, at that point it just defeats the purpose of all ranged weapons in the mod.\n",
